                  Dr. Ahmed Lo was born in 1955 in Tawfekh near Touba. He memorized the Quran in Ndame, in the Louga region of Senegal. He learned basic Islamic knowledge first in Touba and then in Saint-Louis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this time, he developed an excellent level in Arabic, allowing him to write beautiful poems. However, he felt the need to learn more about his religion despite financial constraints.

                  An adventurer in search of knowledge, he traveled with friends through Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, Nigeria, and Egypt, where he worked briefly to fund his pilgrimage to Umrah in Saudi Arabia in 1980.
