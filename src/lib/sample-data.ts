        content: `Distributed systems are computing systems whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.

Key Characteristics:
1. Concurrency of components
2. Lack of global clock
3. Independent failures

Advantages:
- Scalability: Systems can grow by adding more nodes
- Reliability: Redundancy provides fault tolerance
- Performance: Parallel processing improves throughput
- Accessibility: Distributed systems can serve users globally

Challenges:
- Complexity in design and debugging
- Network latency and unreliability
- Data consistency issues
- Security concerns across boundaries

Common Patterns:
1. Client-Server Architecture
2. Peer-to-Peer Systems
3. Microservices Architecture
4. Publish-Subscribe Systems
5. MapReduce and Big Data Processing

Modern Applications:
- Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
- Distributed Databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)
- Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)`

        content: `Ethical considerations are increasingly important in AI and machine learning development.

Core Principles:
1. Fairness - Avoid bias and discrimination
2. Transparency - Explainable AI systems
3. Accountability - Clear responsibility chains
4. Privacy - Data protection and user privacy
5. Autonomy - Respect human agency

Bias in AI:
- Training data bias perpetuates historical inequalities
- Algorithmic bias from model design choices
- User bias from interaction patterns
- Measurement bias from proxy variables

Mitigation Strategies:
1. Diverse training datasets
2. Regular audits for bias
3. Explainable AI techniques
4. Ethical review boards
5. Stakeholder involvement

Impact Areas:
- Criminal Justice: Risk assessment algorithms
- Healthcare: Diagnosis and treatment recommendations
- Finance: Lending and credit decisions
- Employment: Hiring and promotion algorithms
- Education: Student assessment and resource allocation

Future Considerations:
- Regulation and compliance (AI Act, etc.)
- Global governance frameworks
- Interdisciplinary collaboration
- Continuous evaluation and improvement`

4. Land use changes (deforestation)
5. Waste decomposition

Effects:
- Rising sea levels
- Extreme weather events
- Ecosystem disruption
- Agricultural impacts
- Public health challenges
- Economic costs

Mitigation Strategies:
1. Transition to renewable energy
2. Improve energy efficiency
3. Protect and restore forests
4. Develop sustainable agriculture
5. Carbon capture technologies

Adaptation Approaches:
- Infrastructure resilience
- Water management systems
- Crop diversification
- Coastal protection
- Early warning systems

Role of Different Sectors:
- Energy: Renewable transition
- Transport: Electric vehicles
- Industry: Clean technologies
- Agriculture: Sustainable practices
